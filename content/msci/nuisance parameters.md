Parameters that are not of interest, but must be accounted for in analysis of data.

We tend to [[marginalization|marginalize]] or *integrate over* all possible values of nuisance parameters.
	In this way, we don't assume any priors on their values.


These are often parameters that describe the experiment, and not the scientific model. e.g. calibration measurements.
