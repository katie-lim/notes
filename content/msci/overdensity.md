The deviation of the density at a point from the average density.

$$
\delta(x) = \frac{\rho(x)-\overline{\rho}}{\overline\rho}
$$
or
$$
\delta_{\rho} = \delta \rho / \rho
$$
for mass overdensity.


## History

- In the early universe, it was almost completely uniform. So the fractional overdensity $\delta(x)$ was **very small** ($|\delta| \ll {1}$).
	- This is known as a *linear* regime. Here we can use *linear* perturbation theory, up to 1st order.

- Now in the later stages of the universe, in galaxy clusters, we can see $\delta$ as high as 1000.
	- This would be a *non-linear* regime.
