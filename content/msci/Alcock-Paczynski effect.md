We cannot measure galaxies' distances directly, only their redshifts.

We can convert redshifts to distances using the [[distance-redshift relation]] $r(z)$.

However, if wrong values of the [[cosmological parameters]] are used in $r(z)$, then the distances will be wrong. This induces geometric distortion, and the resulting galaxy distribution will not be isotropic.

Since observations suggest the universe is isotropic, we can use the AP effect to probe cosmological parameters.
