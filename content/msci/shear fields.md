From [[msci-meeting-22-06-2022]]:

- Light travels a very long distance to get to us, and gets distorted by the gravitational pull of matter. This means our images get distorted slightly (usually very little, only by 1-2%). We call this **cosmic shear**.
- Since it's caused by the gravitational pull of matter we can describe this using a potential. (?)
- The effect isn't really like a "shear" in geometry.
