From [[msci-meeting-22-06-2022]]:

- Most surveys don't cover the whole sky. Consider a function that has a value of 1 where we have data and 0 where we don't. (Like a mask function.)
- Imagine multiplying the galaxy density field by this function. When we multiply two functions, their Fourier coefficients get convolved. So the window function is the convolution of the mask function (?). We don't need to worry about it too much here.
