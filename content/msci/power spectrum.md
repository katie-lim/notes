Denoted by $P(k)$. Defined by

$$
\left< f_{\ell m}(k)f_{\ell'm'}^{*}(k') \right> = P(k) \delta(k-k')\delta_{\ell \ell'}\delta_{mm'}.
$$



The [[Fourier transform]] of the [[two-point correlation function]].

Denoted by $P(k, r)$.

Defined by
$$
\langle f(\mathbf{k}, r), f^{*}(\mathbf{k}'',r) \rangle = (2\pi)^{3} P(k; r) ~ \delta_{D}(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}').
$$
