A type of noise that comes from having lots of discrete objects. Can be described by Poisson statistics.

Originates due to e.g.

- the discrete (quantised) nature of electric charge, in electronics
- the particle nature of light, when counting photons.

Thus, all astronomical measurements have *noise*.
