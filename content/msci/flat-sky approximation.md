From [[msci-meeting-22-06-2022]]:

Most astronomical surveys don't cover the entire sky â€“ at most, they cover about half the sky.

Imagine a survey that covers a small patch of sky. This patch has a small angular diameter and is at a large distance $r$. So, approximately, it's flat, not spherical.

Then in this case we can use Cartesian coordinates and the maths/Fourier analysis becomes a lot easier.
