Galaxies' redshifts are contributed to by

- cosmological expansion, and
- [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]], which produce a Doppler shift.

Thus, when we plot the spatial distribution of galaxies as a function of redshift, instead of distance, the distribution appears **distorted**. This is due to the effect of the peculiar velocities causing an additional redshift.


Redshift-space distortions only affect the **radial component**.
