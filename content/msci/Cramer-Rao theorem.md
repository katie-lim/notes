The best possible [[covariance matrix]] on the parameters is given by the [[Fisher information matrix]] $F^{-1}$.

The Fisher matrix offers the best-possible result that can be achieved, given the information we have.

It shows us the best-case scenario for how well we can constrain cosmological parameters given a set of observations.
