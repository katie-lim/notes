A dimensionless factor that parameterises the expansion of the universe.

It relates the [[proper distance]] $d(t)$ between two objects, moving with the [[Hubble flow]], at time $t$, to their distance at some reference time $t_{0}$:

$$
d(t) = a(t) d(t_{0})
$$
or

$$
d(t) = a(t)d_{0},
$$

where $d_{0}=d(t_{0})$, and $a(t_{0})=1$.
