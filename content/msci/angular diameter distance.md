The angular diameter distance in the transverse direction is

$$
D_{A} = \frac{r(z)}{1+z}
$$

where $r(z)$ is the [[comoving distance]].

This uses the small angle approximation: $d\theta = s / D_{A}(z)$. Here $s$ is the object's physical size.

$D_{A}$ is a good approximation for an object's "real distance" ([[proper distance]]).
