Denoted by $\Lambda$. The energy density of space, or the vacuum energy that arises in quantum mechanics.

It was initially assumed to be 0. However, since the discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, we believe $\Lambda$ might actually have a *positive* value.


It is the simplest possible explanation for [[dark energy]] – a constant energy density that is inherent in the fabric of spacetime itself.

It's used in the [[ΛCDM model]], the current standard model of cosmology.
