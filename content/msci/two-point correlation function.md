The excess probability of finding a neighbour at a radius $r$ from a given galaxy. Denoted by $\xi$.

Can be measured in $z$ and $\theta$.

It's strictly speaking an *autocorrelation* function, since it's the correlation of the galaxy number density field with itself.


## Explanation

Imagine a sphere of radius $r$.

If galaxies were uniformly distributed, we'd expect to find $4\pi r^{2} \delta r \overline{n}$ galaxies in a shell of thickness $\delta r$.

However, galaxies are *not* uniformly distributed. Under the influence of gravity, galaxies fall towards overdense regions, and **cluster** together.

Therefore, we actually see

$$
N = 4\pi r^{2}\delta r \overline{n} (1+\xi)
$$

galaxies in the shell, where $\xi$ is the **two-point correlation function**.

$\xi(r)$ and the [[power spectrum]] of the galaxy distribution, $P(k)$, are Fourier pairs.
