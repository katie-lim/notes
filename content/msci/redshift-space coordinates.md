Given by
$$
(s, \theta, \phi) = (r, \theta, \phi) + (u, 0, 0)
$$
where

- $(r, \theta, \phi)$ are the [[real-space coordinates]],
- radial distances $s$ are estimated from Doppler redshifts, and
$$
u = \mathbf{v}(r) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} / H_{0}
$$
is the radially projected **peculiar** displacement.
