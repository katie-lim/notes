- Our galaxy surveys only detect galaxies up to a certain magnitude limit, e.g. only galaxies brighter than magnitudes of 25.
- So there is a selection function that describes the probability of a galaxy being detected as a function of redshift (or equivalently distance).
- The weighting function is designed to give more weight to distant galaxies, and undo this effect. If we knew the selection function we could divide by it. However, this is a bad idea when we consider very distant galaxies, of which we might detect only 1 or 2. Then dividing by the selection function would give huge weight to these galaxies which is not great.
- We try to find a balance between undoing the selection function and giving too much weight to distant galaxies.
