[[redshift-space distortions|Redshift-space-distortions]], related to the [[Fingers of God]] effect, where distortion is caused by motion of galaxies falling towards the centre of a cluster.

Usually leads to *flattening* of structure, instead of elongation.

It's a much smaller effect than the Fingers of God effect, and can be distinguished from FoG because it occurs on larger scales.
