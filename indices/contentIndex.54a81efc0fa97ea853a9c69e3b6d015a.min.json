If we knew the selection function we could divide by it. However, this is a bad idea when we consider very distant galaxies, of which we might detect only 1 or 2. Then dividing by the selection function would give huge weight to these galaxies which is not great.\n- We try to find a balance between undoing the selection function and giving too much weight to distant galaxies.","lastmodified":"2022-09-26T18:55:41.477734158Z","tags":null},"/msci/window-function":{"title":"window function","content":"\nFrom [[msci-meeting-22-06-2022]]:\n\n- Most surveys don't cover the whole sky.
